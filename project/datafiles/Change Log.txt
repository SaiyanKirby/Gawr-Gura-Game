[b_0002]
- added a forward attack

- improved jump
	- you can hold the button for a longer jump
	- you can double jump

[b_0003]
- lots of sprite tweaks
- adjusted forward attack, it now allows for a quick 3 hit combo
- the forward attack now applies forward momentum (and upward in the air), which can be used as movement tech
- added a zelda 2 style down stab attack in the air that bounces off of enemies, which also refreshes your double jump
- new blue slime which has 5 hp instead of 3
- slimes now have a death effect

[b_0004]
- added this changelog to the included files
- more sprite tweaks and small adjustments to movement
- added a sprite for when you take damage
- added pop-off damage/healing numbers
- you can now hold the jump button while bouncing off an enemy for a little bit extra height, like a normal jump
- you can no longer cancel the down stab by just letting go of down, but you can cancel it by jumping or attacking forward
