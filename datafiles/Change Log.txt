[Build_0001]
- project started
- basic left/right movement and jump implemented

[Build_0002]
- added a forward attack
- added a slime enemy (doesn't move yet)
- added health bars
- added health regen (1hp every 2 seconds)
- improved jump
	- you can hold the button for a longer jump
	- you can double jump

[Build_0003]
- lots of sprite tweaks
- adjusted forward attack, it now allows for a quick 3 hit combo
- the forward attack now applies forward momentum (and upward in the air), which can be used as movement tech
- added a zelda 2 style down stab attack in the air that bounces off of enemies, which also refreshes your double jump
- new blue slime which has 5 hp instead of 3
- slimes now have a death effect

[Build_0004]
- added this changelog to the included files
- more sprite tweaks and small adjustments to movement
- added a sprite for when you take damage
- added pop-off damage/healing numbers
- you can now hold the jump button while bouncing off an enemy for a little bit extra height, like a normal jump
- you can no longer cancel the down stab by just letting go of down, but you can cancel it by jumping or attacking forward

[Build_0005]
- Under the hood work:
	- Replaced all of the individual input variables with a single grid that tracks everything
	- Added a generic system for menu objects, though it's still incomplete
	- Made all the collision and movement code work with reversed gravity (reverse it with W)
- Added a simple pause menu
- Added a parallax cloudy sky background
- Improved the trident sprites
- Minor sprite palette changes
- Adjustments on attack physics:
	- Attacks in the air no longer gives you horizontal momentum (but still gives a slight upward boost).
	- Attacks in the air have a longer end lag.
	- The above changes are to hopefully prevent flying exploits.
	- You can no longer move left/right while attacking on the ground (you still can in the air)
	These adjustments are subject to change if they don't feel right.

[Build_0006]
- Added a debug command to display hitboxes as red outlines when they're active (CTRL+H)
- Changed the switch gravity button from W to G.
- Fixed the parallax clouds not tiling.
- Added menu selections to the pause menu. The "Options" selection brings up a button remap screen.
- Added button remapping. Supports keyboard, mouse, and xinput gamepads*.
- * Gamepad analogue sticks are not able to be mapped yet, that will be done later.
- There's no logic to prevent you breaking your controls, for example by unmapping confirm. In case you break something, press F3 to reset all the controls to default.

[Build_0007]
- Slightly reduced maximum jump height
- Added support for binding analogue stick inputs to actions
- Removed unbinding keys in the button remap screen
- Added some logic to prevent you from binding confirm and back/pause to the same key, which breaks menus
- Extended the test level
- Added a skeleton enemy
	- Shuffles horizontally forward towards you when you're nearby
	- Jumps when moving up against a wall
	- Goes back to idle state when you get far enough away
