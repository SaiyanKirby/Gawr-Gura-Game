# Gawr-Gura-Game
Platformer game project featuring Gawr Gura and other Hololive members

The plan is to have at least 5 stages, each representing a pair of one Myth member and one Council member, culminating in a boss fight where you save said Myth member from said Council member.
After those 5 stages, there will be 2 more boss fights, and then roll credits.
Stages will be replayable with some hidden secrets throughout.

Megaman games serve as the main comparison for how the levels and boss fights will be designed, though combat will be melee-focused, so more the Zero/ZX games than Classic/X.

I have no deadline or even any reasonable prediction for when or IF this project will be completed.
I work slow, but I'll keep plugging away at it while I have motivation!

Contact me on Discord (@SaiyanKirby#3999) or Twitter (@SaiyanKirby) if you have anything you'd like to talk about regarding this project.
